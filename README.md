# Coherence CLI

The Coherence command line interface (CLI), cohctl, is a lightweight tool, in the tradition of tools such as kubectl, which can be scripted or used interactively 
to manage and monitor Coherence clusters. You can use cohctl to view cluster information such as services, caches, members, etc, as well as perform various 
management operations against clusters.
